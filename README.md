# Accommodations in Ghent during CITCON Europe 2019

This is intended to help participants of [CITCON Europe 2019](https://citconf.com/ghent2019/) in their search for accommodations in Ghent.

I got several requests on Twitter to recommend accommodations in Ghent. Living myself in Ghent, and never having to book a hotel in Ghent, it was a bit difficult to come up with a list. The best thing I could imagine of was to go to the local bookstore and grab a copy of the Lonely Planet and Guide du Routard for Belgium.

## Accomodations

The congres organisation service of the city of Ghent gave me these additional links:

### [Hotel Flandria](http://www.hotelflandria-gent.be/), Barrestraat 3

Budget Hotel

shared/private bathroom incl. breakfast from 58/70.

Near historic city centre.

Hidden in a little street surrounded by canals and stunning cathedrals.

It is located in the heart of Ghent, a few steps away from the most important attractions and the best places to taste the famous Belgian beer and enjoy the beautiful lights of the city.

It is one of the few hotels in Ghent city centre in a quiet neighbourhood and, at the same time, it is close to the vibrant spots of the city.

### [Atlas B&B](https://www.atlas.gent/), Rabotstraat 40

B&B

single/double incl breakfast from 74/84 EUR.

A bit far away from the venue. Off the city centre.

This 1863 townhouse has attractive belle époque, art deco and art nouveau touches, a comfortable communal lounge area featuring maps, globes and an honesty bar, and four distinctive guest rooms themed by continent.

### [Big Sleep](http://www.bigsleep.be/), Hagelandkaai 38

B&B

single/double from 65/90 EUR.

Near Portus Ganda.

The three guestrooms of this friendly B&B in an attractive 1890s townhouse have high ceilings and private showers but shared toilets. The house is decorated with souvenirs of its owners' world travels, but perhaps its most notable features are that it is smoker friendly and has an attractive heated outdoor pool (summer months only). Handy for [Gent-Dampoort station](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/pois/1292361).

### [The Boatel](https://www.theboatel.com), Voorhoutkaai 44

2-star hotel on a boat.

single/double incl. breakfast from 92/126 EUR

At Portus Ganda.

This canal boat has been rebuilt as a hotel and is located at only a minute’s walk from the centre of town with all its historical monuments, museums and shops.

Equipped with 5 charming and cosy rooms of which 3 are standard rooms and 2 luxurious. Each room is decorated in a unique and surprisingly different style with view over the river. Every morning a delicious continental breakfast is served.

*Not recommended by any travel guide. Just added by myself because I'm intruiged by it since the nine years I live close by.*

### [Simon Says](http://simon-says.be), Sluizeken 8

Guesthouse

incl. breakfast from 130 EUR.

**Top Pick by Lonely Planet.**

Near Patershol.

Get in quick to snap one of Simon and Christopher's two fashionably styled guest rooms located above their well-patronised, chilled-out coffee shop in a fabulous part of town.

You can't miss it: it's the brightly coloured art nouveau house on the corner.

Cheery hosts, excellent breakfast and strong organic coffee.


### [B&B Engelen aan de Waterkant](http://www.engelenaandewaterkant.be/), Ter Platen 30

B&B

The five guest rooms combine well-placed modernist and retro touches. The lavish ‘Paola’s Room’ is named for the young Italian princess who stayed here long before becoming Belgium’s (now former) queen.

Housed in Ghent's spectacular twin-turreted former post office. The property's common areas, guestrooms and suites are dark and moody in a wonderful way, with elements of great design at every turn (though note the standard rooms are compact for the price). The hotel also offers fine dining and an ultra-atmospheric bar.
